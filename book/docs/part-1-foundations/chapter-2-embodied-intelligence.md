# Chapter 2: Embodied Intelligence

This chapter explores the concept of embodied intelligence, a cornerstone of modern robotics and Physical AI. We will delve into how a physical body shapes the nature of intelligence and how robots perceive and interact with their environment.

## The Embodiment Thesis

The embodiment thesis posits that intelligence is not a purely abstract phenomenon but is deeply intertwined with the physical form of an agent. In other words, an agent's body, sensors, and actuators are not just peripherals but are integral to its cognitive processes. We will explore the philosophical and scientific roots of this idea and its implications for robotics.

## How Embodiment Shapes Intelligence

A robot's physical characteristics, such as its size, shape, and degrees of freedom, fundamentally constrain and enable its intelligence. A humanoid robot, for example, can interact with a world designed for humans in ways that a wheeled robot cannot. This section will examine the co-evolution of bodies and brains in both biological and artificial systems.

## The Role of Sensors and Actuators

Sensors are the robot's window to the world, while actuators are its means of acting upon it. The type, quality, and placement of sensors and actuators have a profound impact on a robot's ability to perceive, learn, and reason. We will discuss the various types of sensors and actuators used in modern robotics and how they contribute to embodied intelligence.
