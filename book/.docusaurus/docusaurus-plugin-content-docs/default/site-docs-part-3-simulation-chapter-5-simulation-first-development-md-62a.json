  "description": "In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, the ability to rapidly prototype, test, and iterate on complex systems is paramount. Simulation-first development has emerged as a critical methodology, allowing engineers and researchers to design and validate robotic behaviors in a virtual environment before deploying them to costly and potentially dangerous physical hardware.",
